Here's an easy and quick recipe for making fried chicken with your French fries. Firstly, prepare the marinade by combining buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, celery powder, cayenne powder, white pepper powder, kosher salt, MSG, smoked paprika, and whisking them together until thoroughly combined. Marinate three to four pieces of chicken drumsticks, chicken thighs, or chicken wings in the marinade overnight.

Next, prepare the dredge by combining all-purpose flour, potato starch, kosher salt, mushroom soup base powder, garlic powder, white pepper powder, celery powder, cayenne powder, and smoked paprika. Muddle these ingredients together with your fingers to get smaller particles that will make the crust flakier.

Dredge each piece of marinated chicken in the flour mixture, making sure it covers all sides and presses the flour mixture aggressively onto the chicken. Shake off any excess flour and set aside while you dredge the rest of the chicken pieces. 

Deep fry the breaded chicken at 350°F until the internal temperature reaches 165°F and the exterior is golden brown. Drain on a wire rack or paper towel, then season with salt to taste and freshly cracked black pepper.

As for the French fries, you can either use frozen store-bought fries or make them from scratch by cutting potatoes into thin sticks, blanching them in boiling water for a few minutes, and then deep frying until crispy.

For the side dishes, try making corn on the cob with a honey butter mixture and Hush Puppies as suggested in the video. These can be made easily and will complement your fried chicken meal nicely.

Overall, this bucket meal should have everything you need - crispy fried chicken, French fries, biscuits, mac and cheese, corn on the cob, and Hush Puppies. However, it's always a personal preference and you can add any additional vegetables or side dishes to your liking.
