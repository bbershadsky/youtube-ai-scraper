the bucket meal is a classic staple of, American food culture you get your fried, chicken and the millions of sides to sit, down and eat this glorious Fried Chicken, meal and at this point I think people, are kind of getting complacent with what, is good so to make something really, special here I asked you on Instagram, for your top picks for all the bucket, meal sides to create the perfect Fried, "Chicken bucket meal Im going to take", each of those top voted items make brand, new recipes and make the best version of, it I possibly can think of in its, "classic form Im not going to deviate", from tradition it here and since you the, subscribers voted for it you the, subscribers will be tasting it and, really tell us in the most unbiased most, not on my payroll way which items were, better and whether or not and this is, important it is worth actually making is, this the best fried chicken meal yes or, "no lets begin so now were working on", Buttermilk Biscuits you can do this in a, plain bowl with a pastry cutter or two, "forks to break up the butter Im doing", it a food processor so flour goes in, "then youre going to add sugar baking", powder garlic powder and fine sea salt, pop this bad boy on and and then just, "let it rip till everythings thoroughly", "combined now once thats done youve got", unsalted cold butter that goes into your, flour do not over pulse this you will, end up with essentially just a boring, "pastry dough so were going to pulse", this very lightly all the chunks of, "butter dont have to be exactly the same", "matter of fact its a good thing if some", are a little bigger some are a little, smaller but generally speaking you want, them on average the size of like a large, English p PE EA going to stir in fresh, grated cheddar cheese it can be sharp, medium sharp however you want it but, please grate your own fresh all right so, "Im going to stir that in using only a", "fork till thoroughly combined Im going", to stir in buttermilk another option is, heavy cream although heavy cream will, make these much more Rich mix that with, a fork take get a Shaggy dough mix this, together if this is not enough, buttermilk you can always add touch more, "till it comes together now once youve", "got a rough dough its kind of clumpy", "theres going to be bits of flour thats", fine dump it onto a work surface get it, "into one Mass dont touch it too much", with your bare hands and melt the butter, first roll your dough out into a rough, rectangle sort of right about there if, your rolling pin is sticking you can use, a tiny tiny bit of bench flour bench, scraper fold the edges in and then the, other end fold over that middle piece so, now you sort of got like a letter bring, everything in one more time turn it now, you should be into more of a rectangular, "shape at this stage all right were", going to give this one more fold boom, another letter and look how much more, "shapely it is so were going to roll out", one more time this needs to be at least, 1 in thick that is the key to tall, biscuits yourself a sheet tray with, parchment on top we have a 3in biscuit, cutter you can also go up to 3 and 1/2, in or even wider always punch straight, down got big bits of butter interspersed, in layers of dough now pop that onto, your sheet tray rinse and repeat with, all your biscuit dough when you run out, of space for punching you just bring, everything back together give it a, "little quick fold dont touch it too", much and roll it out one more time you, just punch out more biscuits you can fit, about 12 to a tray right we got four, "rows of three I didnt go to college you", can put these just straight up in the, oven but I like to brush the tops with a, little bit of extra buttermilk this goes, into an oven at 425 fenit for about, 15ish minutes now this is totally, "optional but while thats going if you", want a little on the biscuits saucepan, salted butter medium heat and then just, "let it melt once thats melted cut off", "the heat youre just going to add one", clove of very finely chopped garlic, swirl that in after 15 minutes you pull, out some beautiful golden brown puff, tall flaky layered biscuits if you went, "the route of the garlic butter youll", brush that on immediately when they come, "out be generous dont be shy biscuits", "lets see what they think we are going", to be comparing this to a popular bucket, Meal which items were better and whether, or not it is worth actually making today, we have taste testing Leela David and, "Amber so Im going to give you one of", each so this is number, "one now were going to move on to number", two so go ahead and open your hand up, "lovely what is this its still biscuits", Oh I thought it was, chicken okay so you can take your, blindfolds off go ahead and write the, number you prefer the number one or, number two, the texture was immediate like as soon, as I bit into it I could tell it was, crispier on the outside and you could, tell that there were the layers inside, it was cheesy it was buttery there was, something really salty all throughout, the biscuit that like you could, immediately tell and that adds a lot, more flavor interest into part of what, makes a meal really good but for me it, was just the texture immediately it was, so much less salty and the cheddar and, "it didnt turn to like gum when youre", "eating it like exactly didnt like stick", to the roof of your mouth the first, "biscuit was so dry and then its also", like sticking to the roof of your mouth, "whereas this one you dont have that at", all this is really where the crucial, element comes in which is is it worth it, the amount of time committed and spent, on this which is about 25 to 30 minutes, "yeah definitely for half an hour thats", like so easy you could have fooled me I, thought that took a lot longer but that, was really really delicious yeah, "seriously the best biscuit Ive ever had", "75% of it is also big time so while its", baking you could be making your Mac and, Cheese your fried chicken or whatever, "youre making with it I should clarify", just for people who are watching both, biscuits were cooked and made ahead of, time and both of them were reheated to, the same temperature could have fool me, "thats pretty impressive actually do", sawi KFC this might not be a butt better, but somehow it always ends up being one, moving on macing Chase allinone Pop, "theres no baking required you just need", "to make a r thats the only really extra", step so Boiling Pot of salted water, macaroni in and just let that boil, according to package directions more, specifically tal Dente all right once, "thats boiled drain your pasta and the", beautiful thing is you can now make your, "R in here your pots going to go back on", medium unsalted butter in let that melt, completely okay once your butter is, "fully melted youre going to add in", "allpurpose flour and whisk that youre", basically just going to cook and stir, "about 2 minutes just till the Flours", "cooked out once thats cooked out youre", going to add heavy cream followed by, whole milk a lot of recipes use half and, half but I do prefer the milk and heavy, cream cuz heavy cream somehow Just Hits, heavy all right keep whisking heating, just until thicken and silky smooth now, "once thats there cut the heat", completely off and add in your cheddar, cheese first fresh grated whisk that in, "and just whisk until its fully melted", next American cheese grated and grer, also grated now all you got to do is, "just keep mixing until everythings", fully melted and fully Incorporated, season that to taste with salt always, check your cheese sauce people assume oh, "theres cheese in here I dont need to", add salt what the you talking about now, "youre going to add your cooked pasta", directly in there fold that together it, "might be simple but lets see what they", think everybody loves Mac and Cheese I, feel like we can all agree on that I, love mac and cheese is my favorite yeah, "Im going to be really really real and", "crucial about this its just comfort", "food its just that thing that you", "really I mean theres some thats not", "that good but cant really go wrong with", "it so were going to come in with number", one now on to number, Music, two the winner of this one is KFC, unfortunately something about number two, tasted grainy after a couple seconds, "number one was creamier and like thats", "what Im looking for in a consistency I", said number two because I actually think, that the first one tasted crany what, "tore me like why I wasnt sure because", the second one the noodles were a little, mushy I think I like the second one, because the sauce I think was a little, bit thinner the noodles were a little, bit more cooked the first one I had an, issue with cuz I felt like it was just a, "little bit clumpy and grainy I didnt", really taste as much of the flavor in, that one versus the second, one total cook time for this is 15, minutes moving on for your mashed, "potatoes were using Yukon Gold cuz", these potatoes are gold but also because, they make really creamy mashed potatoes, "so youre going to peel all your", "potatoes you dont have to but I like to", "its just easier to mash and I dont", want any peel in my final product, "whatsoever but its totally fine to", "leave them into its not going to hurt", "the dish then youre going to cut those", into large chunks place them in a cold, pot of water set that to high heat, season your pot of water with just a bit, of salt to taste you will add more salt, "later but were just getting it started", I like to cook with my salt and bring, "that to a rolling boil while thats", going saucepan or a small sauser pan, unsalted butter going in a lot of it and, cloves of garlic so we let this melt, over medium low heat I will say if you, "dont want to confy the garlic you can", very easily just lightly crush it and, let it come up to heat with this and, "itll lightly perfume it and then strain", it out once the butter is fully melted, allow the garlic to cook stirring, occasionally until the garlic is, incredibly soft about 7 to 10 minutes, "then add in your whole milk once thats", steamy hot use an immersion blender to, blend until as smooth as possible now, once your potatoes are soft and easily, picked with the fork drain them push all, your potatoes through a potato ricer or, Mash with a potato masher you can do, that in the same pot or a heat prooof, Bowl then straining your hot butter, mixture through F mesh C in the potatoes, Ser until thoroughly combined season to, taste with salt and serve beautifully in, a medium to large bowl and garnish with, chives and fresh cracked black pepper, "thats mashed potatoes theyre", definitely going to like this one so, next up is a beloved classic mashed, "potatoes okay this one Im really", excited about I love mashed potatoes so, "much me too Im down for it its not my", "favorite potato but I recognize its got", to be part of the meal I recognize that, "its a truth I must cope with we have", number, "one tastes kind of garlicky its pretty", "smooth texture its good though here we", go number, "two okay this was hard cuz theyre both", really good in their own ways I can just, taste the KFC and the KFC mashed, potatoes I really liked the first one, because of the smooth texture I like the, garick in it I think the second one was, good but I also think the second one was, like maybe bacony but yeah the first one, was really solid the first one was, delicious I I agree like garlicky was, "flavor that came through to me it wasnt", "just potato like it wasnt just plain", mashed potatoes there was something, mixed in with there to give it a little, bit of like extra oomph in it it was, really good I think the second one, tasted Dusty the the KFC one personally, "thats a really good like I dont know", something about KFC mashed potatoes just, tasted like dust I think the second one, was like lumpy this going to be, "hilarious if Joshs are number two well", "mine was number two no Im kidding Im", "kidding Im kidding Im kidding were", "back on the leaderboard although its a", "w it doesnt feel like enough of a w", "only because I think KFCs mashed potato", are the worst mashed potatoes on planet, Earth the dusty quality is because it, "starts as dust it literally does its", like instantized potato KFC when are you, just going to use real potatoes bro this, is a slightly longer mashed potato that, set it can go I guess while other things, "are going right youre boiling pasta", "youre baking the biscuits so all in", "start to finish its about a 25 30", minute process worth it not worth it, worth it worth it worth it things are, moving in a positive direction moving on, next up a very easy grilled corn on the, "cough were doing grilled corn you could", "also boil it honestly you dont even", need oil but if you want to put a little, oil oil on it you can just brace them on, get some extra color put it on the hot, "side of a grill thats it I want it", ripping hot so the corn might pop a, "little bit thats good as soon as its", charred and hot on one side flip it and, repeat on all sides about 2 minutes per, side okay at this stage obviously you, can add your cobs or you can just leave, "them whole its fine but if youre going", to serve corn a lot of time people like, to do it with butter I like to do with, brown butter so small sauce, pan unsalted butter medium heat very, "basic so youre going to let this melt", completely then once that melts just let, it keep cooking over medium heat, "stirring occasionally until its a nice", deep Brown almost burnt but not quite, "the key here youre going to take your", "brown butter youre going to brush your", corn generously with the brown butter, okay coat every little corn corny, crevice some of this is going to fall, off so be aggressive take some flaky, salt and immediately just coat the whole, thing that fresh butter is going to help, "the salt stick its going to look nice", "its going to give you a little surprise", when you take a little bite some more of, "your butter on top and serve lets see", what they think the next one is corn how, do you guys feel about corn recognize, "that its part of the meal but its not", "my favorite I dont like corn on the cop", "because it get stuck in my teeth its", just so irritating cream corn is good, "sometimes Im the opposite way like", grilled corn on the cob like that Char, is really good creamed corn usually not, my thing and then dig there you go now, you got a, "lot oh youll recognize this corn thats", "a scary statement Jesus Christ oh youll", "recognize this corn that didnt sound so", good coming out of my mouth go straight, up and straight down take your, blindfolds off give it a vote number one, or number number, two that was going to be an easy win I, "mean thats kind of an unfair", competition the difference is insane the, first one I was like this is so like not, it for me the second one actually like, converted me to someone who enjoys corn, because I traditionally do not enjoy, "corn at all me too thats so funny", "because I dont normally like corn and", the first one I put in my mouth and I, was like who I was like I know I have to, keep chewing this and I know I have to, "swallow it but I dont want to but the", second one was like oh yeah the first, "one just wasnt seasoned at all like it", "was very muted it didnt have any flavor", to it the second one just immediately, popped off the spoon so the total time, to make this is 10 to 15 minutes worth, it not worth it worth it worth it 10 to, 15 minutes is nothing absolutely worth, "it to be clear its literally just", grilled corn and brown butter and salt, "thats it we didnt add anything", "else thats the irony its like you", "didnt really even have to do that much", KFC whatever you did with the mac and, "cheese couldnt you just done that with", the corn now moving on push Puppies, "Youre going to take shashido peppers", and Char them over an open flame on a, "grill with a blowtorch I dont care just", Char them now while those are charring a, lot of hush puppies have onions in them, and mine do too but I wanted something a, "little more classy so were going with", "the humble shallot and youre going to", very finely chop this borderline mince, "this onion youre going to use one large", one or two small ones now once these are, charred like this just do the same thing, "to the other side were not going to", totally blacken these we just want to, soften them up and get a little Char on, them now once these are pretty finely, "cut youre going to run your knife", through it just a few times I want these, onions to disintegrate whenever we cook, these Hush Puppies my mom does not like, onions but she does like hush puppies, and if I cut them small enough she will, "not know theyre in there and say wow", "this is so good and Ill be like hm now", "for the shashido peppers you dont even", "need to peel these if you dont want to", "Im not going to its okay to get a", "little bit of char in there its going", to taste incredible add a beautiful, level of smokiness and depth of flavor, this is exactly what we want go ahead, and slice these bad boys up you can, leave the seeds in or you can take them, "out I dont care for those who dont", "know shashido Peppers arent even really", spicy although every once in a while you, "do get one thats weirdly spicy for some", reason even though the rest are not, again run your knife through this and, get these bad boys super fine just like, "the onion dont go too fine cuz I do", want little bits and pieces Dam one of, the easiest things of all time is making, a hush batter bowl allpurpose flour, cornmeal sugar salt Creole or cajun, spice garlic powder fresh cracked black, pepper baking powder and baking soda, whisk all your dry ingredients together, "and then were going to add all of our", wet ingredients milk a little bit of oil, could be vegetable oil avocado oil just, "room temp liquidity one whole egg youre", "finally chopped shallot youre finally", chopped charge Shido and just mix all, that together into one beautiful batter, if your batter is looking a little thin, "dont worry let it sit for like 5 10", minutes that cornmeal will soak that up, and then we fry once you have fry oil at, "350 fhe thats vegetable oil avocado oil", "beef fat lard I dont care halfway up in", "a 6 to 8 quart dutch oven youre going", to scoop your batter and just hush, "puppies dont need to be perfect in", shape they just need to be perfect in, flavor sounds like a Bob Ross quote, anyway now just let these fry all you, need to focus on is the color keep keep, that oil temperature regulated and make, sure you get them to a nice golden brown, they need to be deeper than this keep, "flipping them every so often theyre", going to puff up they look so nice oh, "theyre so bloated and cute let them rip", this color is where I want it but I want, this bubbling to subside just a little, bit just a tiny bit darker after 2 to, three minutes they should be a beautiful, deep golden brown take them out of the, oil and drain on a paper towel ow, "theyre very hot dont touch them like I", am you can give them just a touch of, "salt to taste immediately while theyre", still hot so the salt sticks and repeat, with the rest you can serve this with, the remad if you like or some sort of a, flavored mayo or a dipping sauce but, "theyre great straight up KFC does not", have a hush puppy matter of fact a lot, "of chicken places dont really serve", Hush Puppies anymore probably because, the way they make them suck I included, this for two reasons number one because, I think hush puppies are awesome and I, wanted to show an easy way to make an, amazing Unforgettable one but the second, and more important reason is I want to, mess with the taste testers a little bit, "Im going to give them two hush puppies", "but theyre both going to be mine and I", want them to vote and say which one is, "better so well see if they choose or", "recognize that theyre the same lets", find out these are a fun one this is a, new thing we have two different versions, for you and it is Hush Puppies I love, "Hush Puppies my dads made Hush Puppies", before he told me that they literally, used to throw them at dogs to get them, "to hush and thats why theyre called", Hush Puppies I think Lea is lying I am, not okay so this is number, "one I dont think Ive ever had these", before does it make you want to throw it, at a dog no absolutely not this is going, to go down in history in the comment, "section and everyones going to be like", Le look the rose hush puppies at dogs, number, "two this one was a difficult one Im", really not sure they were both really, "good I dont", know it was tossup it was hard for me to, tell the difference one tasted I guess, "maybe it was a little bit warmer thats", what made it different yeah I kept, having to like feel them like I was, going back and I even had like bite of, the first one again cuz I was like, trying to compare both of them at the, same time and like trying to feel the, texture differences on the outside but, they were both like really crispy on the, "outside and for something Ive never", tried before both of them felt really, good I feel like the second one gave me, like a taste of KFC still in my mouth, like you know like the way KFC smells, "well we won because theyre both exactly", the same they were both my I knew I yeah, KFC does not have a hush puppy now you, might be thinking well why did you do, this you just want to with people yes, but also the second reason is to keep, "you on your toes see now you dont know", what to expect there is no anticipatory, answer but I like that you guys were, thoughtful about it like where their, heads at up Josh come on so the total, time to make the hush puppies actually, really fast if you have oil already hot, and ready these only take like 10, minutes at most 15 maybe 20 minutes if, "youre really slow worth it yes or no I", would never make a hush puppy I feel, "like theres other things you could make", "like Hush Puppies otherwise I dont know", "if Id go out of my way to do that", "because Ive never fried anything before", I am a little scared of frying something, I would much rather have biscuits I, "think I agree I also wouldnt make the", hush puppies if you want hush puppies, like make these but moving on French, fries look these are very much of a, "secondary item if youre already", spending all this time on all these, "other things Im going to give give you", the best crispy french fry shortcut of, all, time these are the frozen fries from the, frozen section yes and when you fry them, "in oil theyre ridiculously good this is", what most restaurants do actually sorry, to tell you that if you want you can, make a quick little Cajun seasoning so, "small bowl salt MSG thats right sugar", white pepper onion powder cayenne powder, garlic powder and finally a little bit, of smoked paprika or regular paprika, this together till combined and that is, "your spicy caj and seasoning lets have", "a conversation about when youre frying", things in a pot number one this pot is, "is Max full see how full this is its", about 3/4 the way up maybe even a little, under 3/4 the way up never ever fill, your frying pot more than that end of, story second if your pot ever begins to, "look like its going to overflow turn", "the heat off immediately Im serious", "thank you now 350° F heres our frozen", "fries lets get ourselves a spider can", also use tongs and just carefully drop, "them into your hot oil and well do that", in two to three batches I mean also use, your eyeballs right like if it looks, like it can take a little bit more fry, then put more fry see okay no more see, "how its right on the edge there thats", "the pot telling me hey Josh thats", enough once the bubbling has subsided, and your fries are stiff these need to, "be crispy okay so youll pull them out", with your spider let them drain a bit, shake off the excess oil and then, directly into a large heatproof bowl, some frozen fries come pre-seasoned be, sure to taste one of the fries before, "you season it you dont want to overs", salt these we have AR Cajun seasoning, "were going to season these bad boys up", taste for seasoning do little more I A A, little salt in there too dump them out, onto a wire rack and repeat with the, rest of your fries once those fries are, done just load them up into a big bowl, "serve them however you want dont be shy", and that is your French fry this is, going against the number one winning, fast food french fry the KFC french fry, good luck KFC so this is an interesting, "one it is french fries Im actually", really excited to see how this one turns, out I almost want KFC to win I actually, really like their french fries I think, "theyre probably the best Ive ever had", at any fast food chain in my entire life, "heres number one one fry to rule them", "all thats a good fry this is right up", your alley David mhm m nice Sho string, "fry y Thats good fry number two both of", "these have been reheated so theyre the", same temperature, "each Ill accept whatever fate that", there is in store for me, today yeah yeah personally for me I like, the thinner crispier fries the first one, was more of like a Sho string type, "french fry Vibe and it also its a", little spicy had like some spice to it, the seasoning was really good I like, that I could taste like the pepperiness, of it I like the texture I like that it, was really crispy I felt like the second, "one I wasnt a huge fan of because I", felt like I could almost taste like the, "fry oil and I was like thats less", appealing to me second one was crunchier, I like the texture more the flavoring, was there with like the seasoning on the, "first one if Im going to pick a french", fry to go with a fried chicken meal I, would rather go for the second one the, irony is this recipe was written in mind, to make these fries as quick and easy as, physically possible these fries only, take 10 minutes to make so the question, is worth it or not yeah I would, definitely try it if it was only 10, "minutes for 10 minutes like thats", pretty easy peasy the only thing that we, "made was the seasoning thats it that", was essentially the winning reason I, "think so if youre going to make", anything off the fries maybe just buy, KFC fries and season them with the, seasoning or you just make the seasoning, and keep it in your pantry moving on, this is the most important part of this, video the fried chicken the king of the, "bucket meal lets make it first youre", marinade buttermilk garlic powder onion, powder celery powder cayenne powder, white pepper powder kosher salt MSG, smoked paprika y whisk till thoroughly, combined if you want grap Fried Chicken, make sure your chicken is as fresh as, "possible youre going to add three to", four pieces each of the following depend, on their size that is chicken drumsticks, chicken thighs chicken wings tossed, together make sure to get the marinated, under their skin and place in the fridge, overnight now on the dredge allpurpose, flour potato starch kosher salt mushroom, soup base powder garlic powder white, pepper powder celery powder cayenne, powder smoked paprika dried time I like, to muddle it with my fingers just to get, the time a little smaller a little whisk, till thoroughly combined now we dredge, if you want to get the extra little, "Crispies its the flakes the parts that", kind of open up like shards of glass, then I would highly recommend that you, take your hand dip it into your marinade, get a little bit on your fingers and, just flick that into your flour mixture, not mandatory but you will get more, flakiness it will adhere a little better, "when you do this okay Im going to", sprinkle a little bit of my dredge onto, "a sheet tray Im going to take our", marinated chicken put it in your dredge, cover it with more dredge and press that, flour mixture aggressively make sure you, get all sides get under the skin shake, off the excess no bald spots onto the, board and repeat the rest of your, chicken pieces now once all your chicken, is bread red only a few pieces at a time, "Id say like maybe three pieces Max", "were going to deep fry those at 350° F", and once the turtle temperature register, is 165 fah and the exterior is a, beautiful golden brown drain on a wire, rack or on a paper towel lightly, seasoned with salt to taste and then, finish with fresh cracked black pepper, "and serve lets see what they think the", "final chicken youre the only one that", "made a preference Im going to give you", a leg all right we also have only thighs, after that okay number two thigh a leg, and Madam a thigh the one that I voted, for had much more flavor it was a lot, more crispy the one I voted for was just, instantly juicier there was a lot more, complex flavor in it the one that I, voted for I love the crispiness I love, the texture a lot I love the instant, burst of flavor from like how juicy it, "was whereas the one that Im not voting", for it was not my favorite thing in the, "world that is the KFC now Im kidding", "its me again I told you assuming youre", making this with the proper recipe from, beginning to end this is probably going, to take you depending on the sizes of, chicken anywhere between 30 to 45, minutes to make the Fried Chicken not, worth it would you rather just go to KFC, and get the Fried Chicken yourself I, "personally wouldnt fry the chicken", "myself I wouldnt go to KFC but I would", go out and buy it personally yes I would, fry that chicken that was awesome I, think I would give this a shot I think I, "would try it I definitely wouldnt go to", KFC for fried chicken out of all the, things you had today what was your, favorite or your go-to the thing that, surprised me was the corn that was, really really really good I had high, expectations for like the mac and cheese, "the biscuits its like those are Staples", of a fried chicken meal for me but the, corn blew me away how good that was and, how easy it was apparently surprisingly, "for me Ive been thinking about those", Hush Puppies I was definitely converted, "by the corn but now I cant stop", thinking about Hush Puppies it was the, "corn for me too because corn isnt", something that I would normally make but, it was easy and it tasted so good so I, would definitely for sure make that at, home do you feel like this had, everything that a bucket meal can have, was there anything missing I think for, me I like to have a little bit more, vegetables so probably like green beans, "or Im a real big fan of fried o overall", I think for especially for what we had, it was a very classic bucket meal I, would have said the same thing I thought, something green would have like, contrasted well with everything else but, I love the biscuit I love the mac and, cheese I thought it was really really, good honestly the one thing that was, missing is fried okra cuz fried okra for, "me as a bucket meal staple thats crazy", I hate okra the one thing I think we, "learned today is maybe just if youre", going to go and eat a fried chicken, bucket meal either make it yourself or, spend the time to find a good place, special thank you to our tasters and of, course everybody who voted to make this, video possible we appreciate you we love, you and we kiss you, Music
